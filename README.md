Problem 1 solution:
All but one guest will eat the cupcake once and will eat it as soon as they see it. There will be one person who will be the dedicated counter, when he comes and the cupcake is gone he increments the counter, and requests a new cupcake. When he counts to all the guests - 1 then everyone must have been in the maze since everyone eats the cupcake once. The runtime of the program is random since it uses a random number generator to get the guests but the runtime is around 100ms for 50 guests.

Problem 2 solution:
I chose solution 2 since it is the easiest to implement. It was essentially the first problem but without the specific person being in the maze at the same time.
